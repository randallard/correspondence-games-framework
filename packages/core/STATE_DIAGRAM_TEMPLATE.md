# State Diagram Template

This template provides the standard structure for documenting game states in the Correspondence Games Framework.

## Overview

Every correspondence game should have **separate state diagrams** for:
1. **Hot-Seat Mode** - Both players on same device
2. **URL Mode** - Players on different devices

**Why separate diagrams?**
- Different flows and complexity
- Easier to understand each mode independently
- Clearer documentation for developers
- Better for debugging specific mode issues

---

## Document Structure

Your `STATE_DIAGRAMS.md` file should have this structure:

```markdown

## Mode Selection Diagram

**Purpose:** Show how users enter each mode from the main menu.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> MainMenu
    MainMenu --> HotSeatMode: Click "Hot-Seat Mode"
    MainMenu --> URLMode: Click "URL Mode"
```

**Keep this simple** - just show the entry points.

## Hot-Seat Mode Diagram Template

**Purpose:** Complete flow for local multiplayer on one device.

### Template

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Player1Name

    Player1Name --> Player2Name: Submit name
    Player2Name --> PreGame: Submit name

    PreGame --> Playing: Start Game

    Playing --> Handoff: Make move (game continues)
    Handoff --> Playing: Click "I'm Ready"

    Playing --> GameOver: Win/Draw

    GameOver --> PreGame: Play Again
    GameOver --> [*]: Main Menu

    PreGame --> [*]: Main Menu
```

### Key Characteristics

**Hot-Seat Mode MUST have:**
- ‚úÖ Sequential name collection (Player 1 ‚Üí Player 2)
- ‚úÖ Handoff screen between turns (prevent cheating)
- ‚úÖ Both player names stored separately (`player1-name`, `player2-name`)
- ‚úÖ Pre-game screen showing both names
- ‚úÖ NO URL generation/sharing
- ‚úÖ NO localStorage warnings

**States:**
1. **Player1Name** - Collect first player's name
2. **Player2Name** - Collect second player's name
3. **PreGame** - Show both names, ready to start
4. **Playing** - Active gameplay
5. **Handoff** - Pass device to other player
6. **GameOver** - Show results

## URL Mode Diagram Template

**Purpose:** Complete flow for remote play via URL sharing.

### Template

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> InitialLoad

    InitialLoad --> Player1Setup: No URL (new game)
    InitialLoad --> LoadFromURL: URL present

    state Player1Setup {
        [*] --> P1Name
        P1Name --> P1PreGame: Submit name
        P1PreGame --> P1FirstMove: Start game
    }

    state LoadFromURL {
        [*] --> ParseURL
        ParseURL --> DeterminePlayer: Valid URL
        ParseURL --> Error: Invalid URL

        DeterminePlayer --> PlayerXName: No saved name
        PlayerXName --> UpdatedPlaying: Submit name

        DeterminePlayer --> UpdatedPlaying: Has saved name
    }

    P1FirstMove --> ShareURL: Generate URL
    ShareURL --> WaitingForP2: Show share section

    WaitingForP2 --> UpdatedPlaying: P2 loads URL

    UpdatedPlaying --> MyTurn: My turn
    UpdatedPlaying --> WaitingForThem: Their turn

    MyTurn --> GenerateURL: Make move
    GenerateURL --> WaitingForThem: Show updated URL

    WaitingForThem --> MyTurn: They make move

    MyTurn --> GameOver: Win/Draw
    WaitingForThem --> GameOver: Win/Draw

    GameOver --> Player1Setup: Play Again
    GameOver --> [*]: Main Menu

    Error --> [*]: Main Menu
```

### Key Characteristics

**URL Mode MUST have:**
- ‚úÖ Single player identity (`my-name`, not player1/player2)
- ‚úÖ Player ID system (persistent UUID)
- ‚úÖ URL generation after each move
- ‚úÖ Share URL interface
- ‚úÖ "Your turn" vs "Waiting" states
- ‚úÖ localStorage warning on name entry
- ‚úÖ First-time join vs returning player detection
- ‚úÖ localStorage cleared error handling
- ‚úÖ Full state encoding (turn 1) vs delta encoding (turn 2+)

**States:**
1. **InitialLoad** - Determine if new game or loading URL
2. **Player1Setup** - First player creates game
   - P1Name - Collect name (with warning)
   - P1PreGame - Ready to start
   - P1FirstMove - Make first move
3. **LoadFromURL** - Loading shared game
   - ParseURL - Decode and validate
   - DeterminePlayer - Figure out who I am
   - PlayerXName - First-time join (name prompt)
4. **ShareURL** - Display URL for sharing
5. **WaitingForP2** - Player 1 waiting for Player 2 to join
6. **UpdatedPlaying** - Active game state
7. **MyTurn** - I can make a move
8. **WaitingForThem** - Waiting for opponent
9. **GenerateURL** - Creating share link after move
10. **GameOver** - Show results
11. **Error** - Invalid URL or localStorage cleared

---

## State Documentation Format

For **each state**, document:

### State: [StateName]

**Condition**: The React state conditions that trigger this state
```typescript
gameMode === 'hotseat' && player1Name === null
```

**Display**:
- List exact UI elements shown
- Headers, buttons, forms, messages
- What's clickable, what's disabled

**Transitions**:
- Event ‚Üí Action ‚Üí Next State
- Be specific about state changes

**Example:**

### State: HSPlayer1Name

**Condition**: `gameMode === 'hotseat' && player1Name === null`

**Display**:
- Header: "üéØ Game - Hot-Seat Mode"
- Sub-header: "Player 1 (X)"
- Form with label: "Enter your name:"
- Input field: `id="player1Name"`, autoFocus, required, maxLength={20}
- Button: "Continue"
- NO localStorage warning

**Transitions**:
- Submit form ‚Üí
  - Store in `localStorage['correspondence-games:player1-name']`
  - Set `player1Name` in React state
  - Go to `HSPlayer2Name`

---

## Critical Differences Between Modes

### Hot-Seat Mode

| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|---------------|
| **Player Identity** | Two separate identities (`player1-name`, `player2-name`) |
| **Turn Management** | Handoff screen between turns |
| **State Persistence** | localStorage only |
| **Name Collection** | Sequential (P1 ‚Üí P2) |
| **Warnings** | None needed |
| **Game State** | Stored locally, no sharing |

### URL Mode

| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|---------------|
| **Player Identity** | Single identity (`my-name`), role determined by game |
| **Turn Management** | "Your turn" vs "Waiting" messages, no handoff |
| **State Persistence** | localStorage + URL encoding |
| **Name Collection** | Individual (only my name) |
| **Warnings** | ‚ö†Ô∏è "Keep tab open, don't clear cache" |
| **Game State** | Encoded in URLs for sharing |

---

## Common Elements

Document shared components that appear in both modes:

### Game Board/Play Area

**Display**:
- [Describe game-specific board/interface]
- Current player indicator
- Move history (if applicable)
- Status messages

### Game Over Screen

**Display** (both modes):
- Winner announcement or draw message
- Final game state
- "Play Again" button
- "Main Menu" button

**Display** (URL mode only):
- NO share URL section when game is over

### Main Menu

**Condition**: `gameMode === null`

**Display**:
- Game title
- "Play Hot-Seat Mode" button
- "Play URL Mode" button

---

## State Variables Reference

Document all React state variables:

### React State

```typescript
gameMode: 'hotseat' | 'url' | null
turnPhase: 'playing' | 'handoff'  // Hot-seat only
player1Name: string | null          // React state for UI
player2Name: string | null          // React state for UI
gameState: GameState | null         // Persisted game state
shareUrl: string                    // URL mode only
myPlayerNumber: 1 | 2 | null       // URL mode only
myPlayerId: string                  // URL mode only
```

### Game State (Persisted)

```typescript
{
  gameId: string
  // Game-specific fields
  currentTurn: number
  currentPlayer: 1 | 2
  player1: { id: string, name: string }
  player2: { id: string, name: string }
  status: 'playing' | 'player1_wins' | 'player2_wins' | 'draw'
  checksum: string
}
```

### localStorage Keys

**Hot-Seat Mode:**
- `correspondence-games:player1-name`
- `correspondence-games:player2-name`
- `correspondence-games:my-player-id`
- `[game-name]:game-state`

**URL Mode:**
- `correspondence-games:my-name`
- `correspondence-games:my-player-id`
- `[game-name]:game-state`

---

## Common Pitfalls

Document common mistakes and how to avoid them:

### ‚ùå Confusing React State with Game State

**Wrong:**
```typescript
// Using React state for game logic
if (player1Name === 'Alice') { /* game logic */ }
```

**Correct:**
```typescript
// Using game state for game logic
if (gameState.player1.name === 'Alice') { /* game logic */ }
```

**Rule:** React state is for UI, game state is for game logic.

### ‚ùå Wrong localStorage Detection (URL Mode)

**Wrong:**
```typescript
if (gameState.currentTurn > 0) {
  // Show localStorage cleared error
}
```
This triggers error for Player 2's first join!

**Correct:**
```typescript
const playerNameInGameState = myPlayerNumber === 1
  ? gameState.player1.name
  : gameState.player2.name;

if (playerNameInGameState && playerNameInGameState.trim() !== '') {
  // Player joined before but localStorage gone - ERROR
} else {
  // First time joining - show name prompt
}
```

### ‚ùå Using Wrong localStorage Keys

**Hot-Seat:** `player1-name` and `player2-name` (two separate people)
**URL:** `my-name` (single person, multiple games)

Don't mix them up!

## Implementation Notes

### Mermaid Syntax Tips

**State names:**
- Use descriptive names (not S1, S2, S3)
- Prefix with mode: `HS` for hot-seat, `URL` for URL mode
- Example: `HSPlayer1Name`, `URLMyTurn`

**Composite states:**
```mermaid
state CompositeState {
    [*] --> SubState1
    SubState1 --> SubState2
}
```

**Transitions:**
```mermaid
State1 --> State2: Event description
```

### Documentation Tips

1. **Be specific:** "Button: 'Continue'" not "A button"
2. **Include examples:** Show actual code conditions
3. **Cross-reference:** Link to related docs
4. **Keep updated:** Sync with code changes
5. **Test it:** Verify diagrams match actual behavior
